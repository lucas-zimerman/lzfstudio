<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
<div class="info" style="margin-left: 30vh; margin-right: 30vh">
    <p>I initially delved into programming with C, creating games and crafting my own multiplatform SDK for building terminal apps and games. Later, I transitioned to the mobile realm, creating my first app for the UWP platform. Since 2018, my focus has been on back-end and mobile development. After 2022, I expanded my stack to encompass a wider range of languages and frameworks, with proficiency in .NET, Java, Swift, and TypeScript being among the highlights.</p>
